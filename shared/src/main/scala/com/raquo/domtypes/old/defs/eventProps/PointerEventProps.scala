/**
 * Most of today's web content assumes the user's pointing device will be a mouse.
 * However, since many devices support other types of pointing input devices,
 * such as pen/stylus and touch surfaces, extensions to the existing pointing device event models
 * are needed and pointer events address that need.
 *
 * Pointer events are DOM events that are fired for a pointing device.
 * They are designed to create a single DOM event model to handle pointing input devices such as a mouse,
 * pen/stylus or touch (such as one or more fingers).
 * The pointer is a hardware-agnostic device that can target a specific set of screen coordinates.
 * Having a single event model for pointers can simplify creating Web sites and applications
 * and provide a good user experience regardless of the user's hardware.
 * However, for scenarios when device-specific handling is desired,
 * pointer events defines a property to inspect the device type which produced the event.
 *
 * The events needed to handle generic pointer input are analogous to mouse events
 * (mousedown/pointerdown, mousemove/pointermove, etc.).
 * Consequently, pointer event types are intentionally similar to mouse event types.
 * Additionally, a pointer event contains the usual properties present in mouse events
 * (client coordinates, target element, button states, etc.)
 * in addition to new properties for other forms of input: pressure, contact geometry, tilt, etc.
 * In fact, the PointerEvent interface inherits all of the MouseEvent's properties thus facilitating
 * migrating content from mouse events to pointer events.
