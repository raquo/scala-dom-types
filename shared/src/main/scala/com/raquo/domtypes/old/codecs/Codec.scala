/** This trait represents a way to encode and decode HTML attribute or DOM property values.
  *
  * It is needed because attributes encode all values as strings regardless of their type,
  * and then there are also multiple ways to encode e.g. boolean values. Some attributes
  * encode those as "true" / "false" strings, others as presence or absence of the element,
  * and yet others use "yes" / "no" or "on" / "off" strings, and properties encode booleans
  * as actual booleans.
  *
  * Scala DOM Types hides all this mess from you using codecs. All those pseudo-boolean
  * attributes would be simply `Attr[Boolean](name, codec)` in your code.
